# Data carpentry: R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. 

The lesson starts with some basic information about syntax for the R programming
language, the RStudio interface, and moves through to specific programming tasks,
such as importing CSV files, the structure of data frame objects in R, dealing
with categorical variables (i.e. factors), basic data manipulation
(adding/removing rows and columns), and finishing with calculating summary
statistics and a brief introduction to plotting.

## Prerequisites

The lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio.
Learners should have R and RStudio installed on their computers. They will also
need to be able to install R packages from CRAN, create directories, and
download files.
See [the lesson website](https://castanedam.github.io/DTRA_workshop_R/instructor/index.html)
for instructions on installing R, RStudio, and the required R packages.
